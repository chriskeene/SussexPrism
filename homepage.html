<p>This site is a early preview of the new design of our catalogue. In September this new design will take the place of the existing catalogue and the old 'Standard Catalogue'.</p>


<p>The new catalogue is still under active development, and new features will be added constantly between now and September.<p>

<p>We're very interesting in any comments you have on the work so far, let us know using the <a href="feedback">online feedback form</a> or using the email address: <a href="mailto:lib-feedback@sussex.ac.uk">lib-feedback@sussex.ac.uk</a>. </p>
